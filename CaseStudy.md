# Case Study Questions:

####### You are a Chief Technology Officer of a Multi-National Company. The technical team seek your guidance for the choice of framework to create native mobile and desktop app. The team has a strong expertise of C# and .Net framework. But the team is not large enough to handle your diverse requirement, i.e. you seek them toÂ develop apps that can run on Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows from a single  code-base. Therefore, the technical team seek your guidance to the question of the choice of framework.

## 1. What framework would you suggest for the development of Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows applications, and why? Justify with necessary diagrams.

    As the Chief Technology Officer of a multinational corporation, it is recommended to use .NET's Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI) for the development of applications for Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows. This is because .NET MAUI is a cross-platform framework that allows for the creation of native mobile and desktop apps using C# and XAML, and allows for the development of apps that can run on multiple platforms from a single shared codebase. .NET MAUI also provides various features such as a layout engine for page design, support for data binding, the ability to customize UI element handlers, cross-platform APIs for accessing device features, and cross-platform graphics functionality. Additionally, .NET MAUI uses a single project system with multi-targeting capabilities and offers .NET hot reload, which allows for real-time modification and testing of both XAML and managed source code.
